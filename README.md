# Diceverest

Diceverest is a small Unity project for experimenting with dice mechanics and map layouts. It is intended as a starting point for prototyping tabletop style gameplay in Unity.

## Opening the project

1. Install **Unity 2022.3.30f1** (LTS) or a newer compatible version.
2. Clone this repository.
3. In Unity Hub select **Open** and choose the `Diceverest` folder contained in this repository.

Unity Hub will generate project files and open the editor.

## Running the sample scenes

The project includes a couple of scenes located under `Assets/Scenes/Debug Center`.

- **DiceTest.unity** – shows basic dice rolling behaviour using the scripts in `Assets/Scripts/Dice`.
- **MapTest.unity** – placeholder scene for map generation experiments.

To try the samples:

1. In the Unity Editor, open one of the scenes from the `Assets/Scenes/Debug Center` folder.
2. Press the **Play** button to run. Use the on-screen UI or editor controls to interact with the scene.
3. Check the console for any debug output.

For debugging, you can attach your C# IDE (Visual Studio, Rider, etc.) to the Unity editor while playing the scene.

## Project goals

This repository serves as a sandbox for developing dice-rolling systems and simple map based mechanics. Feel free to use it as a learning tool or foundation for your own experiments.
